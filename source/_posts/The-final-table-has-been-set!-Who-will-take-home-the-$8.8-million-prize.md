#  John Cynn takes down the WSOP main event, claiming top honours and $8.8 million!

John Cynn, a professional poker player from Indianapolis, has won the World Series of Poker (WSOP) main event, taking down top honours and a whopping $8.8 million payday!

Cynn had been one of the big chip leaders throughout the final table, but faced some stiff competition in the heads-up stage against Tony Miles. However, Cynn eventually emerged victorious to take down one of the most prestigious titles in poker.

This was Cynn's first ever WSOP main event title, and he now joins an elite group of players who have won both the WSOP main event and the World Poker Tour (WPT) championship.

Here's how the final table played out:

Seat 1: John Cynn - 116,600,000

Seat 2: Tony Miles - 43,200,000

Seat 3: Michael Dyer - 26,600,000

Seat 4: Nicolas Manion - 16,200,000

Seat 5: Aram Zobian - 10,200,000

Seat 6: Artem Metalidi - 6,175,000


  Cynn began the final table as one of the big stacks and was able to make some aggressive moves to stay ahead of the pack. He elimination Nicolas Manion in sixth place and then eliminated Artem Metalidi in fifth place. 

 Michael Dyer was then eliminated by Tony Miles in fourth place and it came down to a heads-up battle between Cynn and Miles. 

 Cynn started with a slight chip lead but Miles was able to grinding back and even took a lead at one point. However, Cynn regrouped and eventually managed to win the title after a gruelling heads-up battle lasting more than four hours.

#  Chips fly as familiar faces hit the rail on day 7 of the main event

Running low on chips and staring down a table filled with accomplished competitors, Chris Moorman and Marvin Rettenmaier were among the high profile names to hit the rail on day 7 of the World Series of Poker main event.

The huge field of 7,865 players was reduced to just 512 on Wednesday, with Moorman exiting in 523rd place for $21,464 and Rettenmaier following in 539th for $19,240.

Moorman – a three-time WSOP bracelet winner – was looking to make his fourth final table but ultimately came up short after spiking a queen on a jack-high board against ace-ten.

Rettenmaier, meanwhile, lost a big pot against eventual chip leader John Cynn to exit in dramatic fashion. With blinds at 4,000/8,000, Rettenmaier shoved all in from under the gun for 79,000 with king-queen suited and Cynn made the call with ace-king. The board ran out two clubs and two spades to give Cynn the pot and send Rettenmaier home empty handed.

Other notables to fall on day 7 included bracelet winner Christopher Frank (752nd – $15,716), former November Niner Pierre Neuville (773rd – $15,716), and online superstar Fedor Holz (830th – $14,592).

John Cynn entered the day as one of the shorter stacks but surged into the lead after eliminating Rettenmaier. The American now has over 30 million chips in front of him as he looks to take home poker’s most coveted prize.

#  Joe Cada makes a miraculous comeback, but falls short in heads up against John Cynn

Joe Cada, who won the 2009 World Series of Poker Main Event, made a miraculous comeback on Tuesday, July 17th, but fell short in heads up against John Cynn.

Cada was down to his last two big blinds and four antes (~$18,000) when he got involved in a huge pot with Cynn. Cada hit two pair on the turn with king-ten against Cynn's ace-king and managed to win the hand, doubling up to about $36,000.

Cada then went on a heater, winning another dozen or so pots in a row and surging into the chip lead. However, Cynn was not done yet. The final hand came when both players had just under three big blinds left. Cada put in a raise preflop with king-jack and Cynn called with ten-six suited. The community cards produced two hearts and a club, giving Cynn two pair and the title of world champion.

"I feel like I let everybody down," said Cada after coming up short in heads up. "I'm sorry to my supporters." 

"It sucks," said runner-up Cynn. "But I'm so happy right now." 

John Cynn is the new world champion of poker, taking home $8.8 million for his victory. Joe Cada earns $5 million for his second place finish – still an incredible accomplishment given that he started the day with just two big blinds!
