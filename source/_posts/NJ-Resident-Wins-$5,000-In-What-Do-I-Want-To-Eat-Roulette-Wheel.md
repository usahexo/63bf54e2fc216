#  Restaurateur Claims Victory In NJ's First Ever What Do I Want To Eat Roulette Wheel

The novelty of the game was not lost on customers as they flooded the new Italian restaurant in Hoboken, NJ. Some came for the chance to eat something they may never have again, others were just there to have a good time. But one person in particular saw the potential in the new game-night attraction: the restaurateur.

The roulette wheel has been spinning at Joe's Italian Restaurant for two weeks now, and business is booming. Owner Joe Venti is claiming victory after the first ever game of What Do I Want To Eat Roulette Wheel. "It was a gamble, but it's paid off," Venti says.

Venti credits his success to two things: his passion for food and his willingness to take risks. And this risk was definitely worth it- the average spend per customer has increased by 20%. He's even had to hire an extra server to keep up with demand.

So what exactly is What Do I Want To Eat Roulette Wheel? It's pretty simple, really. Customers spin a giant roulette wheel with different dishes listed on it instead of numbers. They then get to choose whichever dish they land on.

There are some restrictions- certain dishes are only available on certain days of the week, and appetizers can't be chosen as main courses. But otherwise, Venti leaves it up to chance. "It's all about giving people an opportunity to try something new," he says. "I might not be able to please everyone all the time, but at least they're going to walk away with a good story."

Venti's gamble has definitely paid off- not only is business booming, but he's also getting free publicity from local news outlets and social media. So if you're ever in Hoboken, NJ and looking for something unique to do, be sure to check out Joe's Italian Restaurant- you may just get lucky and land on your dream dish!
