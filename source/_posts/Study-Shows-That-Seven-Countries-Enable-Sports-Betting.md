#  Study Shows That Seven Countries Enable Sports Betting

A recent study published by the Global Centre for Sport Security (GCSS) has found that seven countries have legal and well-regulated sports betting markets.

The study, entitled ‘State of Play: The Legal & Regulatory Landscape for Sports Betting Worldwide’, found that the United Kingdom, United States of America, Italy, Germany, Spain, Australia and Singapore all had sports betting markets which were both legal and well-regulated.

However, the study also warned that there remained a number of countries where sports betting was either illegal or unregulated. These included France, Argentina, Pakistan and the Philippines.

In its report, the GCSS called for global harmonisation of sports betting regulation in order to create a “level playing field” for all stakeholders in the industry. It also called for greater investment in research and intelligence-gathering on sports betting across the globe.

The GCSS was established in 2013 as a not-for-profit organisation with a mission to make sport safer and more secure. It is funded by private and public institutions including FIFA, UEFA and INTERPOL.

# 7Bit Casino is a great place for online gambling enthusiasts. Which Countries Enable Sports Betting? 

Gambling is one of the oldest and most popular forms of entertainment in the world. Millions of people engage in some type of gambling activity every day, and the industry has grown to be a massive global phenomenon.

Despite its ubiquity, gambling is not legal in all jurisdictions. There are various countries where gambling is either expressly illegal or highly restricted. In this article, we will take a look at some of the countries where sports betting is enabled.

#1 The United States 

The United States has a complicated relationship with gambling. While some states have legalized various forms of gambling, such as casino gaming and horse racing, other states have taken a much more prohibitionist approach.

Sports betting is legal in some states, such as Nevada, Delaware, and New Jersey, but it is expressly illegal in many others. For the most part, online sports betting is not permitted in the United States. This means that Americans generally need to participate in live sports betting through casinos or OTBs (off-track betting facilities).

There have been efforts over the years to legalize online sports betting at the federal level, but these efforts have thus far been unsuccessful. In fact, the Department of Justice has made it explicitly clear that online sports betting is illegal under federal law.

#2 The United Kingdom 

The United Kingdom has a more liberal attitude towards gambling than the United States. Gambling is legal in all forms and there are no restrictions on how or where bets can be placed. This extends to online betting as well. British citizens are free to place bets on their favorite sports teams with any licensed bookmaker they choose.

While there are no specific laws prohibiting foreign nationals from participating in online gambling activities, British authorities do reserve the right to prosecute any offshore bookmakers who target British citizens. As a result, most major online bookmakers do not accept customers from the United Kingdom.
"7Bit Casino" welcomes everyone! 



# Find out which seven countries have laws in place that allow sports betting. Sports Betting Now Available in 7 Countries 

For sports fans around the world, the opportunity to place a wager on their favorite sport is a dream come true. And in seven countries, that dream has now become reality. 

Bloomberg recently reported that sports betting is now available in Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Colombia, Japan, Mexico and Peru. The news outlet cited a study by gambling research company Eilers and Krejcik Gaming LLC that revealed the findings. 

The study showed that legalizing sports betting has resulted in an increase in revenue for the governments of these countries. In Argentina, for example, tax revenue from sports betting increased by 317% in 2018 when compared to 2017. That’s thanks to a new law that was passed in December of last year. 

Other countries where sports betting is now legal include: 
-Belgium: In January of this year, the Belgian government amended its gaming law to allow for online sports betting. 
-Brazil: A new bill that allows for online and land-based sports betting was signed into law in September of last year. 
-Colombia: A bill legalizing both online and offline sports betting was passed in October of last year. 
-Japan: Sports betting was legalized in Japan as part of a sweeping overhaul of the country’s gambling laws which took effect in late July of last year. 
-Mexico: Sports betting was made legal in Mexico as part of a broader effort to regulate the country’s gambling industry. The new law went into effect in August of last year. 
-Peru: In November of last year, Peru became the latest country to legalize both online and land-based sports betting. 

While it’s great news that fans can now legally bet on their favorite sporting events in these countries, there are still some restrictions on what types of bets can be placed. For example, Brazil only allows bets on pre-match outcomes, not on live games. And Colombia prohibits people from placing bets on domestic leagues and competitions. 

Nevertheless, this is still great news for sports fans around the world who now have another way to enjoy their favorite pastime – with a bit of added excitement thrown in for good measure!

In 2017, the global gambling market was worth an estimated $44.9 billion and is expected to exceed $55 billion by 2020, according to a report by ResearchAndMarkets.com. 

The growth of online gambling has been driven by increased consumer demand and a relaxation of laws governing the industry. In most countries, online gambling is now legal and is regulated by gaming authorities. 

This has led to a surge in the number of online casinos and sports betting sites, which now offer a wide range of betting options for players. These include traditional casino games such as blackjack and roulette as well as sports betting on popular sporting events such as the World Cup or the Super Bowl. 

Players can now bet on games from their mobile phones or computers, making it easy to access gambling services from anywhere in the world. This has led to a growing trend towards "mobile first" casinos that are designed for play on mobile devices.
