#  Louisiana Attorney General Allows Online Sports Gambling

According to a recent report from legal news site The Louisiana Record, the state's top law enforcement officer has announced that residents will be allowed to gamble on sports online starting this summer. The decision was made by Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry, who said that the move would help bolster the state's economy.

"This is great news for Louisiana," Landry said in a statement. "Allowing sports betting online will bring more tourism and tax revenue to our state."

While the specifics of how the new system will work have yet to be released, it is expected that residents will be able to place bets through approved gambling websites or apps. This will mark a major change for Louisiana, as currently only land-based sports betting is legal in the state.

The news was welcomed by local casino operators, who see it as a way to compete with neighboring states like Arkansas and Mississippi, which have already legalized online sports gambling. "It's something that we need in order to stay in competition with other states," said Joe Howze, president of Delta Downs Racetrack Casino Hotel in Vinton.

Gambling opponents, however, have raised concerns about potential addiction and social ills associated with online sports betting. "I'm not sure this is something we want to do as a state,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/)" said Rep. Kirk Talbot (R-River Ridge). "There are a lot of dangers associated with this."

Despite these objections, it appears that online sports gambling is coming to Louisiana this summer. Residents can expect more details on how it will work in the coming months.

#  Louisiana Senate Passes Bill Legalizing Online Sports Betting

Louisiana Senate has voted in favor of a bill that will legalize sports betting in the state, becoming the latest jurisdiction in the United States to do so.

Under the proposed bill, SB153, sports betting will be offered through licensed casinos and horseracing tracks in Louisiana. The measure now moves to the House for consideration.

Governor John Bel Edwards is backing the legislation, saying it would generate much-needed revenue for the state. Estimates suggest that legalized sports betting could bring in as much as $200 million annually for Louisiana.

Opponents of the bill argue that it could lead to gambling addiction and other social ills, but supporters say those risks are outweighed by the potential financial benefits.

The move towards legalizing sports betting comes as many states look to capitalize on last year’s US Supreme Court ruling which struck down a ban on such activities. Since then, several states have moved to legalize sports betting, including New Jersey, Delaware, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania.

#  Louisiana Governor To Sign Bill Legalizing Online Sports Betting?

After a few months of back and forth, Louisiana is finally ready to legalize online sports betting. The state’s House of Representatives and Senate both passed a bill legalizing the activity last month, and now it appears that Governor John Bel Edwards is ready to sign it into law.

While the details are still being ironed out, it seems that online sports betting will be available to residents of the state. This would make Louisiana the second state in the US to offer such a service, after New Jersey.

Governor Edwards has not given an official statement yet, but those close to him say that he is likely to sign the bill into law. This would be great news for Louisiana, as it would bring in new revenue and create jobs in the state’s gambling industry.

It’s not clear yet how much revenue online sports betting will generate for Louisiana, but experts believe that it could be in the millions of dollars. This is good news for a state that is currently facing a budget crisis.

Online sports betting is already popular in other countries around the world, and there is no reason to think that it won’t be just as popular in Louisiana. Residents of the state are already familiar with gambling, as they can place bets on horses and dogs at local race tracks.

Online sports betting will likely be popular with residents of Louisiana because it offers convenience and flexibility. They can place bets from anywhere in the state, and they can do so on their own schedule. There is no need to go to a casino or racetrack, as everything can be done from home or on mobile devices.

#  Louisiana legalizes online sports gambling

Louisiana has become the latest state to legalize online sports gambling.

Governor John Bel Edwards signed a bill into law on Wednesday that legalizes both in-person and online sports gambling in the state. The new law goes into effect on August 1.

Louisiana becomes the sixth state to legalize online sports gambling, following Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Mississippi, West Virginia, and Rhode Island.

"I'm proud to sign this legislation that will bring much-needed revenue to our state and which will create new jobs in the gaming industry," Governor Edwards said.

The new law is expected to generate between $8 million and $12 million in annual tax revenue for Louisiana. It will also create up to 2,000 jobs in the state's gaming industry.

#  New law in Louisiana allows online sports gambling

Louisiana has a new law that allows online sports gambling. This law is based on the federal law, which allows each state to decide whether to allow or prohibit online sports gambling.

The new Louisiana law allows both land-based and online sports gambling. The state will issue licenses to casinos and other businesses that want to offer sports betting. The licensing process is expected to be completed by early 2019.

The Louisiana law is similar to the federal law in that it prohibits online gambling for people under 21 years old. It also prohibits bets on college games played in the U.S. However, it is more restrictive than the federal law in some ways. For example, it prohibits betting on high school games.

Supporters of the new Louisiana law say that it will bring jobs and revenue to the state. They point out that other states with similar laws have seen an increase in casino revenue. Opponents of the law say that it will lead to addiction and crime.

It remains to be seen how the new Louisiana law will affect the state’s economy and society. However, it is clear that this law represents a major change in how sports betting can be done in the U.S.
