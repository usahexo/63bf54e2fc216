#  Follow These Tips To Win At Blackjack In Online Casino 888 Casino 

Blackjack is a casino card game that is played between the player and dealer. The aim of the game is to get as close as possible to 21 points without going bust. Points are scored by counting the number of each rank, with an Ace counting as 1 or 11 points, whichever is better for the player. Face cards are worth 10 points each, and other cards are worth their face value.

When playing online blackjack, there are a few things you can do to increase your chances of winning:

1. Use basic strategy

Knowing how to play blackjack using basic strategy can help you reduce the house edge from around 0.5% to around 0.3%. You can find basic strategy charts online which will tell you what to do in every possible scenario.

2. Bet on multiple hands

By betting on multiple hands at once, you’re increasing your chances of winning some money. Just be careful not to bet too much money on any one hand, or you could end up losing it all.

#  Strategies For Winning At Blackjack In Online Casino 888 Casino

There are a number of blackjack strategies that can be used when playing the game in an online casino, 888 Casino. However, not all of these will work for everyone and it is important to find the right one that suits your playing style.

One strategy that has been shown to be effective is the “Basic Strategy”. This approach is based on mathematical probability and takes into account the fact that the dealer must hit on a soft 17. It also assumes that you are not counting cards and advises you to stand on totals of 12-16 when the dealer is showing a 2-6 and hit on totals of 17 or higher.

Another strategy that can be used is the “Goldberg’s Sidebet Blackjack” system which involves making side bets in addition to your blackjack bet. This system also uses mathematical probability but takes into account the fact that players can make better decisions when they know more about the odds involved in each hand.

Whichever strategy you choose, it is important to remember to always play within your budget and never bet more than you can afford to lose. Also, make sure you are familiar with the rules of blackjack before playing – this will help you to make better decisions while playing.
