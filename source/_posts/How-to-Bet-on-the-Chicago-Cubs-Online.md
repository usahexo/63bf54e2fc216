#  Tips for Betting on the Chicago Cubs in 2018

The Chicago Cubs surprised a lot of people last year when they made it to the National League Championship Series after winning their Wild Card game. With that momentum going into this year, many people are looking to put money on them to win the World Series. If you're one of those people, here are a few tips for betting on the Cubs in 2018.

1.Pay attention to the starting rotation

One of the biggest reasons for the Cubs' success last year was their strong starting rotation. Jon Lester, Kyle Hendricks, and Jake Arrieta all had sub-3.00 ERAs, and Mike Montgomery proved to be a valuable bullpen addition. This year, Lester and Hendricks are both off to strong starts, so it's important to keep an eye on their performances.

2. Beware of injuries

Even though the Cubs have a lot of talent, they're not immune to injuries. Last year, players like Kris Bryant and Javier Baez were hampered by injuries down the stretch, and this year has been no different. So far, Anthony Rizzo is the only Cubs player who has appeared in every game this season. It's important to keep an eye on which players are getting injured and how severe those injuries are.

3. Bet on games at Wrigley Field

Wrigley Field is a notoriously tough place to play for opposing teams, so betting on games at that stadium can be a lucrative move. The Cubs went 49-32 at home last year and seem poised to have another strong season at Wrigley Field in 2018.
