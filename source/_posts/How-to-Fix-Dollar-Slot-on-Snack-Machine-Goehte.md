#  How to Fix Dollar Slot on Snack Machine Goehte

It’s not always easy to get your money’s worth from a snack machine. Many people find that the dollar slot is too tight, making it difficult to get their desired snack. Here are a few tips for how to fix dollar slot on Goehte snack machines.

First, make sure you are using the right coins. The dollar slot on Goehte machines only accepts quarters, dimes, and nickels. If you try to use other coins, you will likely end up frustrated.

If you are using the right coins and the dollar slot is still too tight, there are a few things you can do to loosen it up. One thing you can try is using a coin that is slightly larger than the ones specified. For example, if you are using quarters, try using dimes instead. This will cause the dollar slot to become loose and easier to use.

Another thing you can do is use a coin with a ridged edge. This will help to grip the sides of the dollar slot and make it easier to insert your coins.

Finally, make sure that your coins are clean and free of any dirt or debris. If there is anything obstructing the coin's trajectory into the dollar slot, it will be difficult to get your snack.

So, I did some research and found an easy way to repair it that works every time!

First, take a small screwdriver and remove the cover on the bottom of the machine. Next, locate the metal arm that goes up and down when you insert your money.
