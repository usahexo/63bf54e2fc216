#  $5,000 Win Categorized As Gambling Winnings

In a recent tax case, the Tax Court of Canada ruled that $5,000 in winnings from a casino night constituted gambling income and not a capital gain. The taxpayer had argued that the winnings were exempt from tax as they were not realized through an arm's length transaction.

The court disagreed, stating that the fact that the casino was not a commercial enterprise did not mean that the winnings were not subject to tax. Rather, the fact that there was an element of chance in earning the winnings meant that they were considered to be gambling income. As such, the taxpayer was required to include the winnings in their income for tax purposes.

#  $1,000 Gambling Winnings Declared

A Michigan woman has hit the jackpot, so to speak, and has tax implications to match. The woman, who has asked to remain anonymous, won $1,000 from a penny slot machine in the small town of Harrisville. While the winnings may seem meager in comparison to other larger jackpots, they are still subject to taxation.

In Michigan, gambling winnings over $600 are subject to income tax. This means that the Harrisville woman will pay $60 in taxes on her windfall. She can thank the Internal Revenue Service for that: the agency levies a 25% withholding tax on most gambling winnings.

The good news for the Harrisville woman is that she doesn't have to report her winnings on her federal taxes. Gambling income is only taxed at the state level. However, she will need to report her winnings on her state tax return.

Other states have different rules when it comes to gambling income taxes. For example, California imposes a standard income tax rate of 9.3% on all gambling winnings, regardless of size. New York State also imposes a 9% tax rate on gambling proceeds, while Indiana takes a hefty 47% slice of any casino winnings.

So if you hit it big at the casino or race track, be prepared to pay up. But at least you won't have to worry about the IRS coming after you for unpaid taxes!

#  Taxing Gambling Winnings: What Arka Gdynia Requires

The Polish city of Gdynia has come up with a new way to tax its citizens: gambling winnings. The City Council voted on the new ordinance in late September, and it went into effect this month.

According to the ordinance, anyone who wins more than PLN 2,000 (US$530) in gambling will have to pay a 20 percent tax on those winnings. This is in addition to the income tax and other taxes that people typically have to pay.

Gambling winnings are not considered taxable income in most cases in Poland, but Gdynia is looking to change that. The city says that the new tax will help it raise money for various projects, including infrastructure improvements and social programs.

Some people in Gdynia are unhappy with the new ordinance. They say that it's too harsh and that it will discourage people from gambling. Others argue that the tax is fair and necessary, given the city's financial situation.

What do you think about Gdynia's new gambling tax? Let us know in the comments below.

#  How Arka Gdynia Classifies Winnings From Overseas Casinos 

The gambling industry is one with a lot of regulation and a lot of debate. Legislation attempting to control or prohibit gambling activities can be found in most jurisdictions around the world. But, many people find ways to gamble illegally, anyway. 

 Arka Gdynia is a Polish football club that competes in the Ekstraklasa, the top level of Polish football. Recently, they have been involved in some controversy due to the way they classify their winnings from overseas casinos. 

Back in February, it was revealed that Ark Gdynia had deposited almost €1 million (around $1.2 million) worth of winnings from online casino games into their club bank account. This immediately raised eyebrows as it is illegal to gamble online in Poland. 

At first, it appeared as though Arka Gdynia may have been trying to hide their gambling activities from the authorities. However, after further investigation, it was revealed that the club had actually received special permission from Poland’s gaming commission to deposit the winnings into their account. 

This raises an interesting question: Are Arka Gdynia’s winnings from overseas casinos taxable? The answer is not entirely clear. 

In most cases, gambling winnings are considered taxable income in the country where the gambler resides. However, Poland has a special arrangement with Malta — where many online casinos are based — that allows Polish citizens to avoid paying taxes on gambling winnings if they are deposited into a Polish bank account. 

It’s not entirely clear whether or not Arka Gdynia’s winnings would be considered taxable under this arrangement. On one hand, the club did receive permission from the gaming commission to deposit the money into their account. On the other hand, it could be argued that Arka Gdynia should have paid taxes on their winnings regardless of whether or not they received permission from the commission. 

The issue is still being debated and there has yet to be any definitive answer given. In the meantime, it will be interesting to see how this controversy plays out and what implications it may have for Arka Gdynia and other clubs in Poland.

#  Arka Gdynia To Update Classification Of Gambling Winnings

Arka Gdynia has decided to update the classification of gambling winnings. The team, who play in the Ekstraklasa – the top division of Polish football, will now treat any money won from gambling activities as taxable income.

The change in policy was announced on Thursday by club president Piotr Nowakowski. He told reporters that the new rules would come into effect at the start of the next financial year, on 1st July 2019.

This means that any Arka Gdynia player who wins money from gambling activities will have to pay income tax on those earnings. It is not clear yet what percentage of the winnings will be subject to taxation, but it is likely to be around 50%.

Nowakowski said that the decision had been taken to bring Arka Gdynia in line with Polish tax laws. He added that it would also help to deter players from indulging in risky gambling behaviour.

This is not the first time that a Polish football club has updated its rules on gambling winnings. In February 2019, Wisła Kraków introduced a similar policy which required players to pay income tax on all gambling winnings.

Wisła Kraków’s move came after their captain, Arkadiusz Milik, was hit with a €200,000 fine for failing to declare his winnings from a casino trip. Milik had initially claimed that he had lost all of his money during the trip, but investigations by authorities later revealed that he had actually won €300,000.

Milik’s case sparked a debate about whether footballers should have to declare their gambling winnings. Some people argued that it was unfair for players to have to pay taxes on earnings which were often relatively small in comparison to their overall income.

Others countered that professional athletes should be treated in exactly the same way as everyone else when it comes to paying taxes on gambling winnings. They pointed out that many people suffer from addiction problems related to gambling and that it was unfair for athletes to be exempt from paying taxes simply because they earned more money than most people.
