#  What is ggr in gambling casino? The answer may surprise you!

Gaming revenue reporters, or ggr, is a term used in the casino industry that refers to the percentage of money wagered that is returned to players in the form of winnings. This statistic is usually expressed as a percentage, and is one of the most important measures of a casino's performance.

There are a few different ways to calculate ggr, but all of them rely on taking into account how much money is wagered and how much money is paid out in winnings. In some cases, casinos will also subtract certain costs, such as bonuses paid to players or jackpot payouts, from their revenue in order to get a more accurate picture of how much money is being won by players.

No matter which method is used, ggr is an important indicator of how well a casino is doing. A high ggr means that the casino is giving players back more of their money in the form of winnings, while a low ggr indicates that players are losing more money than they're winning. As such, casinos typically strive to have a ggr of around 97% or higher.

There are several factors that can affect ggr, including the type of games offered, the payout percentages for those games, and the rules and regulations governing gambling in a particular jurisdiction. In general though, casinos with longer hours of operation tend to have higher ggrs than those that close earlier each night.
