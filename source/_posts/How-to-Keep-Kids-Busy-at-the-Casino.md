#  Kids and Gambling: What You Need to Know

Most parents wouldn't even think about their children gambling, but it's actually more common than you may think. In fact, according to a study by the University of Alberta, 66 percent of preteens have gambled at least once in their lives.

So if your child is asking about gambling, or you've noticed them gambling online or in person, it's important to be aware of the risks and how to keep them safe.

Gambling can be addictive and can lead to financial problems for both children and adults. Additionally, underage gambling can also lead to problems with the law. So it's important for parents to talk to their kids about gambling and understand what they're doing.

If your child is asking about gambling, here are some things you can do:

- Talk to your child about the risks of gambling and why it's important not to gamble money they don't have.

- Help them understand how casinos, lotteries, and other forms of gambling work so they know what they're risking.

- Discuss responsible gambling behaviours, such as only spending money that they can afford to lose, setting limits on how much time they spend gambling each day/week/month, and never borrowing money from others specifically to gamble.

- Let them know that there is always help available if they feel like they're struggling with gambling addiction or debts. The Canadian Gamblers Anonymous website (www.canadiansga.ca) provides a list of resources for both parents and children who are struggling with problem gambling.
